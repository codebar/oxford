# Script for the introduction talk given by the MC

This is meant as a guide to help you prepare for the MC (master of ceremonies) role. Feel free to customize the points below. (Original template by Codebar Barcelona - https://github.com/codebar/barcelona/blob/master/processes/workshops-preparation/script-presentation.md)

“Welcome everyone,
I am Gaetano, I am a junior software engineer and one of the organizers of odebar Oxford. I am sharing this volunteer experience with Suwanna, Connie and Mel. This evening your host will be Suwanna and me.

I can see we have new members today, ___ (Edina). Welcome!

I just want to introduce Codebar, who we are, and what we would love to achieve. Codebar is a UK-based charity. We now have chapters all across the world. The mission of codebar is to help underrepresented groups learn to program in a safe and collaborative environment. For this reason, we want to thank the coaches, and each individual student. As you may know, we have a slack channel, the #oxford-chapter. We also have a #helpdesk channel where people can get help in between workshops.
This workshop will start as soon as everyone is here and not later than 7 PM UK time. We will pair a coach with one or two students and give the number of the room to join in shortly. A few minutes before the event ends we’ll jump into the room to say goodbye.


## Explain code of conduct:
Even though this is a virtual event, we still abide by the code of conduct. We are very passionate about the code of conduct, and creating a safe space for all participants is really important to us. If you feel there has been a violation you can reach out to any of the organizers, either through the slack channel, or we will be available here in Discord. We will also link a copy of the code of conduct on the Oxford Slack channel.
